	<h1>Arizona, Spring Break 2020</h1>

	<h2>My girlfriend and I visited Arizona for Spring Break during the year 2020. COVID-19 had first started to spread so we contemplated cancelling the trip but we eventually went for it. We had to shorten our trip but this was my first time in Arizona and it lived up to it's hype!</h2>

	<h2>Here are some of my favorite memories from this trip!</h2>
