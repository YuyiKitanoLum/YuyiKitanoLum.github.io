	<h1>Door County, Summer 2020</h1>

	<h2>Over the summer of 2020, to get out of the house and away from quarantine for COVID-19, a couple of my friends and I decided to take a trip to Door County in Wisconsin. We safely vacationed and it was a nice time away from the chaos. Door County is famous for their cherries and the cherry pie was memorable!</h2>

	<h2>Here are some of my favorite memories from this trip!</h2>
