	<h2>A little bit about me!</h2>

		<p>I am Yuyi Kitano Lum and I am a senior studying Consumer Behavior and Japanese at the University of Wisconsin Madison.<p>

		<p>I was born in Japan, but I grew up in New York. I love to be outdoors, watch movies, and listen to music, but I also enjoy designing shirts for my school organization. If you would like to see the designs, please visit: <a href="https://yuyilum.wixsite.com/mysite" target="blank">https://yuyilum.wixsite.com/mysite</a></p>

		<p>Above all, I enjoy traveling. I've been to many countries all over the world but recently, I have been traveling around the country. This site helps showcase some of the memories I have made on these trips!</p>
